# T-01: API-ify the Reservation System

## Overview
For this assignment, your team will work together to create an API-enabled version of the reservation system that we've already worked on.  You can rewrite code or borrow from any that you've already written or refactored.  You'll be using FastAPI, which allows you to write API applications fairly easily. We've discussed FastAPI in class and will continue to do so.  The full assignment can be found here: https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/56612/assignments/661290
